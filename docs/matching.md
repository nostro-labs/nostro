# Matching

`reconcile()` takes movements still `pending` after `sync()` and decides each one with a pure
function, `decide(movement, candidates, options)`. Same inputs, same decision: no I/O, no clock, no
randomness, and every decision records its reasons as evidence.

## How a decision is made

1. **Fees are never matched.** They are ignored with a reason and belong to the journal as expense.
2. **Every strategy scores every candidate.** Candidates are the account's open and part-paid
   expectations in the same direction, plus any expectation whose muxed id the movement carries.
3. **Scores combine by family.** Within a family only the strongest signal counts; across families
   they combine as `1 − Π(1 − sᵢ)`. A muxed id and a memo both identify the expectation, so finding
   both is not twice the evidence. A memo plus a unique amount is.
4. **A match needs confidence and a clear winner:** a combined score of at least **0.70** and a lead
   of at least **0.15** over the runner-up. Anything else goes to a person as `AMBIGUOUS_MATCH`, with
   every candidate's signals attached.
5. **A confident match can still be refused** (see below).
6. **Otherwise allocate** `min(amount, remaining)`. Anything left over is an overpayment.

## Strategies

| Strategy | Family | Score | Fires when | False-positive risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `muxed_id` | identifier | 1.00 | paid to the `M…` address issued for the expectation | none if ids are issued uniquely |
| `memo_id` | identifier | 0.95 | `MEMO_ID` equals the memo id asked for, or the expectation's muxed id | payer typo or a reused old invoice id |
| `memo_text` | identifier | 0.85 | normalised text memo equals the normalised reference or requested memo | normalisation is deliberately loose |
| `exact_amount` | amount | 0.60 unique / 0.20 shared | exactly the amount still owed, same asset, inside the window | any two invoices for the same amount |

**An amount alone never settles anything:** 0.60 is below the 0.70 threshold, so a unique-amount match
without a memo becomes a suggestion in the exceptions queue. Lowering `threshold` changes that, and
should be a deliberate decision.

Text memos are normalised before comparison (NFKC, zero-width and control characters removed,
upper-cased, `INVOICE` / `INV` / `REF` / `NO` / `#` prefixes dropped at a word boundary, separators
dropped). `INV-00123`, `inv #00123`, `Invoice 00123` and `ＩＮＶ００１２３` are the same reference;
`INVENTORY-5` keeps its word, and `00123` is not `123`.

## Outcomes

| Situation | Disposition | Exception |
|---|---|---|
| Matched, paid in full or in part | `allocated` | none |
| Matched, paid more than was owed | `partial` | `OVERPAYMENT` for the residual |
| Matched an expectation with nothing left owing | `exception` | `DUPLICATE_PAYMENT` |
| Matched, but in another asset (incl. same code, other issuer) | `exception` | `WRONG_ASSET` |
| Matched, but paid after the expectation expired | `exception` | `LATE_BEYOND_WINDOW` |
| Best candidate below 0.70, or two within 0.15 | `exception` | `AMBIGUOUS_MATCH` |
| Credit with no memo or muxed id, while something is owed | `exception` | `MEMO_MISSING` |
| Credit with no memo or muxed id, nothing owed | `exception` | `UNEXPECTED_CREDIT` |
| Credit whose memo or muxed id matches nothing | `exception` | `UNMATCHED_NO_CANDIDATE` |
| Credit whose source enrichment is missing | `exception` | `ENRICHMENT_MISSING` |
| Debit that matches no payout | `exception` | `UNEXPECTED_DEBIT` |
| Network fee | `ignored` | none |

Every case above has a test in `packages/core/test/matching.test.ts` or `reconcile.test.ts`.

## Not handled yet

These are known gaps, each planned as its own self-contained piece of work:

- **Truncated text memos.** A reference longer than 28 bytes of UTF-8 is cut by the wallet; nostro does
  not yet detect truncation or prefix-match it.
- **`MEMO_HASH` references**, for references too long for a text memo.
- **Known-payer corroboration**, scoring a payment from an account registered as the payer.
- **Amount fingerprints**, a unique sub-unit suffix per invoice for payers who cannot send memos.
- **Claimable balances** as a two-step create-then-claim lifecycle.
- **Several payments in one transaction** sharing a memo.
- **Slippage tolerance** for path payments delivering slightly less than asked.
- **One payment covering several invoices** with no per-invoice reference. Today this is an
  exception for a person to split.
- **A second payment quoting a settled invoice's text reference** is raised as
  `UNMATCHED_NO_CANDIDATE` rather than `DUPLICATE_PAYMENT`: settled expectations are only found again
  through a muxed id.
